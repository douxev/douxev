- 👋 Hi, I’m douxev
- 👀 I’m interested in learning tech stuff
- 🌱 I've been learning Cabinet Making for more than 3 years now as an apprentice, and I try to connect both worlds
- 💞️ You should contact me if you have project ideas to mix tech of any sort and furniture !
- 📖 I am trying to peacefully complete my Cabinet Maker apprenticeship while learning and discovering as much as I can to ease my integration in IT schools which is most exciting.

- 📚 I will try to pass the exams to join 42 or 2600 Schools in Summer (didn't really decide yet, even though I have my preference for 42).
-> Please contact me if you have any suggestions about learning and school orientations
